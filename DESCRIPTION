Description: Collection of functions to assist 'broom' and
    'broom.mixed' package-related data analysis workflows. In particular,
    the generic functions tidy(), glance(), and augment() choose
    appropriate S3 methods from these two packages depending on which
    package exports the needed method. The 'grouped_' variants of the
    generics provides a convenient way to execute functions across a
    combination of grouping variable(s) in a dataframe. Additionally,
    tidy-and glance-like methods from 'parameters' and 'performance' can
    also be accessed.

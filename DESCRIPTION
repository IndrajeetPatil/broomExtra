Description: Provides helper functions that assist in data
    analysis workflows involving regression analyses. The goal is to
    combine the functionality offered by different set of packages
    ('broom', 'broom.mixed', 'parameters', and 'performance') through a
    common syntax to return tidy dataframes containing model parameters
    and performance measure summaries. The 'grouped_' variants of the
    generics provides a convenient way to execute functions across a
    combination of grouping variable(s) in a dataframe.

# `broomExtra`: Enhancements for `{broom}` and `easystats` Package Families

# Raison d'Ãªtre <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="360" />

The goal of `broomExtra` is to provide helper functions that assist in data
analysis workflows involving regression analyses. The goal is to combine the
functionality offered by different set of packages through a common syntax to
return tidy tibbles containing model parameters and summaries.

The package internally relies on the following packages that I contribute to:

  - `{broom}`
  - `{broom.mixed}`
  - `{parameters}`
  - `{performance}`

Since it combines functionality from these two ecosystems, this package has the
following advantages over the underlying individual packages (see examples
below for concrete instantiations of these benefits):

  - Covers more number of regression models than these individual packages.
  - If possible to compute, the output tibbles contains a *p*-value column.
  - More robust to extraneous input arguments that might sometimes cause
    problems for the underlying methods.
  - Follows consistent `tidymodels` column-naming schema.
  - Returns a more comprehensive model performance measure summary.

If you want to add support for a regression model, the natural place to do this
would be to contribute either to `{broom}` or to `{parameters}`.

# Hybrid generics

The `{broom}`-family of packages are not the only ones which return such tidy
summaries for model parameters and model performance. The `easystats`-family of
packages also provide similar functions, more specifically
[parameters](https://easystats.github.io/parameters/) and
[performance](https://easystats.github.io/performance/). Sometimes the `{broom}`
packages might not contain a `tidy`/`glance` method for a given regression
object, while `easystats` packages would and *vice versa*. 

The hybrid functions in `broomExtra` make it easy to retrieve these summaries
with the appropriate method and do so robustly:

  - `broom::tidy` + `parameters::model_parameters` =
    `broomExtra::tidy_parameters`
    
  - `broom::glance` + `performance::model_performance` =
    `broomExtra::glance_performance`

Benefits of using hybrid generics

- The `tidy_parameters` will return a model summary either from `broomExtra::tidy`
or `parameters::model_parameters`, so you get best of the both worlds.


- These functions are robust such that they won't fail if the `...` contains
misspecified arguments. This makes these functions much easier to work with while writing wrapper
functions around `broomExtra::tidy` or `parameters::model_parameters`.

# Generic functions

Currently, `S3` methods for mixed-effects model objects are included in the
`{broom.mixed}` package, while the rest of the object classes are included in the
`{broom}` package. This means that you constantly need to keep track of the class
of the object (e.g., "if it is `merMod` object, use
`broom.mixed::tidy()`/`broom.mixed::glance()`/`broom.mixed::augment()`, but if
it is `polr` object, use `broom::tidy()`/`broom::glance()`/`broom::augment()`").

Using generics from `broomExtra` means you no longer have to worry about this,
as calling `broomExtra::tidy()`/`broomExtra::glance()`/`broomExtra::augment()`
will search the appropriate method from these two packages and return the
results.

## tidy dataframe

Let's get a tidy tibble back containing results from various regression models.

```{r tidy, error = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
library(lme4)
library(ordinal)

# mixed-effects models (`{broom.mixed}` will be used)
lmm.mod <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
broomExtra::tidy(x = lmm.mod, effects = "fixed")

# linear model (`{broom}` will be used)
lm.mod <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
broomExtra::tidy(lm.mod, conf.int = TRUE)

# another example with `{broom}`
# cumulative Link Models
clm.mod <- clm(rating ~ temp * contact, data = wine)
broomExtra::tidy(x = clm.mod, exponentiate = TRUE)

# unsupported object (the function will return `NULL` in such cases)
broomExtra::tidy(list(1, c("x", "y")))
```

## model summaries

Getting a `tibble` containing model summary and other performance measures.

```{r glance, error = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
library(lme4)
library(ordinal)

# mixed-effects model
lmm.mod <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
broomExtra::glance(lmm.mod)

# linear model
lm.mod <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
broomExtra::glance(lm.mod)

# another example with `{broom}`
# cumulative Link Models
clm.mod <- clm(rating ~ temp * contact, data = wine)
broomExtra::glance(clm.mod)

# in case no glance method is available (`NULL` will be returned)
broomExtra::glance(acf(lh, plot = FALSE))
```

## augmented dataframe

Getting a `tibble` by augmenting data with information from an object.

```{r augment, error = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
library(lme4)
library(ordinal)

# mixed-effects model
lmm.mod <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
broomExtra::augment(lmm.mod)

# linear model
lm.mod <- lm(Reaction ~ Days, sleepstudy)
broomExtra::augment(lm.mod)

# another example with `{broom}`
# cumulative Link Models
clm.mod <- clm(rating ~ temp * contact, data = wine)
broomExtra::augment(x = clm.mod, newdata = wine, type.predict = "prob")

# in case no augment method is available (`NULL` will be returned)
broomExtra::augment(stats::anova(stats::lm(wt ~ am, mtcars)))
```

# `grouped_` variants of generics

`grouped` variants of the generic functions (`tidy`, `glance`, and `augment`)
make it easy to execute the same analysis for all combinations of grouping
variable(s) in a dataframe. Currently, these functions work only for methods
that depend on a `data` argument (e.g., `stats::lm`), but not for functions that
don't (e.g., `stats::prop.test()`).

## `grouped_tidy`

```{r grouped_tidy}
# to speed up computation, let's use only 50% of the data
set.seed(123)
library(lme4)
library(ggplot2)

# linear model (tidy analysis across grouping combinations)
broomExtra::grouped_tidy(
  data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggplot2::diamonds, size = 0.5),
  grouping.vars = c(cut, color),
  formula = price ~ carat - 1,
  ..f = stats::lm,
  na.action = na.omit,
  tidy.args = list(quick = TRUE)
)

# linear mixed effects model (tidy analysis across grouping combinations)
broomExtra::grouped_tidy(
  data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggplot2::diamonds, size = 0.5),
  grouping.vars = cut,
  ..f = lme4::lmer,
  formula = price ~ carat + (carat | color) - 1,
  control = lme4::lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"),
  tidy.args = list(conf.int = TRUE, conf.level = 0.99)
)
```

## `grouped_glance`

```{r grouped_glance}
# to speed up computation, let's use only 50% of the data
set.seed(123)

# linear model (model summaries across grouping combinations)
broomExtra::grouped_glance(
  data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggplot2::diamonds, size = 0.5),
  grouping.vars = c(cut, color),
  formula = price ~ carat - 1,
  ..f = stats::lm,
  na.action = na.omit
)

# linear mixed effects model (model summaries across grouping combinations)
broomExtra::grouped_glance(
  data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggplot2::diamonds, size = 0.5),
  grouping.vars = cut,
  ..f = lme4::lmer,
  formula = price ~ carat + (carat | color) - 1,
  control = lme4::lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
)
```

## `grouped_augment`

```{r grouped_augment}
# to speed up computation, let's use only 50% of the data
set.seed(123)

# linear model
broomExtra::grouped_augment(
  data = ggplot2::diamonds,
  grouping.vars = c(cut, color),
  ..f = stats::lm,
  formula = price ~ carat - 1
)

# linear mixed-effects model
broomExtra::grouped_augment(
  data = dplyr::sample_frac(tbl = ggplot2::diamonds, size = 0.5),
  grouping.vars = cut,
  ..f = lme4::lmer,
  formula = price ~ carat + (carat | color) - 1,
  control = lme4::lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")
)
```
